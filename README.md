# Implementation of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with Backpropagation

## Description

This is a Homework project. The assignment was to implement Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models from scratch using backpropagation for my assignment in Advanced Machine Learning course in Armenian code academy.

### Mathematical Operations

The backpropagation for the following mathematical operations/functions is implemented:

- **Addition**
- **Multiplication**
- **Exponentiation**
- **Sigmoid**

### Linear Regression

The Linear Regression model is constructed using the mathematical operations implemented above. It is trained on a provided dataset.

### Logistic Regression

Similarly, the Logistic Regression model is constructed using the mathematical operations implemented. It is trained on a provided dataset.

## Datasets

Two datasets are used for training:

1. **Breast Cancer Dataset**

2. **Diabetes Dataset**

Both datasets are split into training and testing sets using a test size of 20% and a random state of 42.
